# C++ Multithreading Examples

This is a series of examples from simple to complex...

## Using Threads

1. Example 1: Run some simple transient printing in parallel (using function pointers in threads)
2. Example 2: Run some precesses in parallel and get their results (using object functions and ref())
3. Example 3: Run some precesses in parallel and get their results (using lambda)
4. Example 4: Handle thread exceptions in the main thread (using current_exception() and rethrow_exception() and ref())
